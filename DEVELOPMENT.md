**DEVELOPMENT LOG**

**WEEK 1** 11/7 - 11/13--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
  Week 1's meeting consisted primarily discussing project logistics, in addition to\
  the various considerations that will go into the project itself. The group met\
  in person on Sunday, 11/8, going over and completing the project proposal - the group completed\
  the project proposal, picking a dataset, setting our goals, and creating our timeline.\
  Afterwards, the group acquired the dataset and analyzed it, making sure that the dataset\
  would be appropriate for the project's goals.
  
**WEEK 2** 11/14 - 11/20--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
  Week 2's meeting consisted of discussing the data structures that would be implemented, as well\
  as establishing how the data would be pre-processed and formatted, the test cases that would need\
  to be considered, and what work that needs to be done. The group outlined its goal of making an\
  adjacency list class that works with C++'s standard list template, as well as the methods that\
  would need to be implemented in order to make the data structure usable. The group also outlined\
  how the class would store its data, as well as how we would test the class to check if it's working\
  properly.
  
**WEEK 3** 11/21 - 11/28--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
  Although week 3 did not have a meeting due to fall break, the team made progress as outlined by\
  the previous week's meeting. Particularly, the team made progress in three areas: Andrew successfully\
  pre-processed the data into the format desired for our project, and Vincent configured the make and\
  catch files/compilers and completed the test cases. Jeremy and Tyler also made some progress on the\
  AdjList data structure, with all the additional functions being completed, while leaving the constructor\
  and the big 3 to be completed at a later date. The group has also decided to aim to complete one of the\
  traversals by the end of week 4.\
  
  **WEEK 4** 11/29 - 12/5--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
  Week 4's meeting had the team meet in person to work on a few things, such as the BFS traversal and\
  the test cases, with the goal of getting the requirements done for the Mid Project Check-in, which took\
  place on Friday, 12/3. The group worked on debugging some of the test cases, in addition to creating the BFS\
  traversal from scratch, based off of the code provided in lecture, and making sure the git branches and files\
  were in order. The group also outlined what needed to get done before the end of the project, including the\
  deliverables, and briefly outlined timelines for completing them.
  
   **WEEK 5** 12/5 - 12/13--------------------------------------------------------------------------\
   For Week 5 we have been working to finish up the project. We are working on implementing the two algorithms for\
   our graph, Floydâ€“Warshall's and Betweenness Centrality. Ideally we will have these algorithms implemented by\
   Thursday which will allow us to us the weekend to work on deliverables. After implmenting the algorithms we\
   will still need to add a README (three major sections), the written report (goals and results section), and\
   complete the final presentation video which we plan to finish this Saturday.
