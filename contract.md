 The following document details the contract and obligations regarding \
 the final project for group JUSTIN FIELDS. Below includes communication\
 and collaboration expectations for the group.
 
------------------------- COMMUNICATION -------------------------\
 Group members are expected to communicate in an appropriate manner, \
 via either Discord, Facebook Messenger, Email, or other mediums. \
 Members should aim to communicate any issues they have with the \
 project, and respond when first available. Group members should also\
 let other members know when they are pushing their work to the Git,\
 or when any significant relevant changes have been made to avoid \
 losing any work done by any member.\
 \
 The group is expected to meet at least once every two to three weeks \
 as time allows, either in person or via an online medium, such as \
 Zoom or Discord. With proper communication, the group may not even \
 need to meet or be present all at the same time, however ideally\
 the group meets in person together to discuss project logistics and\
 difficulties. Meetings should last at least 15 minutes, with no \
 maximum time limit besides the schedules of the members of the \
 group. Although no designated notes-taker is required, members should\
 aim to take their own notes to solidify their understanding of the\
 assignment and any issues discussed within the meeting.
 
 Each group member should aim to interact appropriately,\
 mostly in regards to respect. Group members should respect other \
 members' time and schedule, as well as respect each others' effort.\
 Members should aim to be actively listening to other members, and \
 communicate as often as they feel they need to. 
 
 Overall, group members are expected to communicate effectively and\
 comfortably. 
 
------------------------- COLLABORATION -------------------------\
 The workload is expected to be split evenly amongst group members,\
 with each member contributing equal effort. If a group member has \
 trouble completing their work on time, or faces technical\
 difficulties regarding the workload, the member should aim to ask\
 for help and communicate any issues they're having, seeking advice\
 from other group members, as well as course advisors. Member can \
 also ask other members to check their work, in order to ensure all\
 parts of the project are functioning as expected. The workload will \
 be assigned as the group sees fit, but likely through the individual\
 skill of each member. 
 
 Each member is expected to contribute hours each week scaled to the\
 difficulty and amount of work put in - although each member should\
 put in the same amount of work, members with work that is innately\
 less difficult should be assigned the more tedious tasks, whereas \
 members with work that is difficult to decipher should be assigned\
 less tasks, with the average workload being the same across the \
 group as a result. Conflicts or time commitments that come up should\
 be communicated with the group, so that other members can assist with\
 any complications that occur.
 
 Disagreements and complications should be resolved as a group - with\
 any major decisions being held democratically. Further disagreements,\
 with members that refuse to cooperate should be brought up to the \
 course staff, and dealt with accordingly. 
 
 Thus concludes the Final Project Contract for the group JUSTIN FIELDS.\
 Below are the signatures of each member.
